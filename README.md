# _go-media-organizer_

Command-line tool written in Go to organise all media files in a directory recursively by date, detecting duplicates.

## Features

- Organizes media (images and videos) by year and month folders.
- Extracts metadata like EXIF and XMP into separated JSON files.
- Detects duplicates (by comparing file checksum) and skips moving/copying them.
- Normalizes the file names.
- Fixes file creation time, by using the one in the metadata if available.

### Planned

- Convert old video formats to MP4 (H.264 + AAC) while tidying up using [ffmpeg >= 4.2](https://ffmpeg.org/).
- Add support for graceful command termination with signals and routines.
- Build a SQLite database with all extracted metadata.
- Build a GUI for the media files, similar to macOS Photos, that will use the SQLite DB (probably under a different repo).

## Requirements

- [go >= v1.15](https://github.com/golang/go)
- [exiftool >= v11.80](https://github.com/exiftool/exiftool)
